# Hoi! 👋(◍•ᴗ•◍)

**I'm a teenager that is passionate about making games and art.** I am creative and kind, but shy and unorganized. 

I'm **16**, **he/him**  
I'm currently learning Pico-8, Python, and Godot. It's a ton of fun! ( ╹▽╹ )

### Here's some fun facts about me!
- (o' ▽ ' )o☆ I currently live in France, and I can speak English, Chinese and French.
- (＾∀＾)ゞ I love birds. In a group of friends, I'm that one guy who'll watch pigeons walking on the street. Someday I wanna adopt a bird!
- ╰(´︶`)╯ I'm currently in highschool learning computer science, maths and science. I want to do maths studies later!

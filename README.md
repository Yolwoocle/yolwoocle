  <h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
</div>

🌵 Nice to meet you! I'm a developer from France passionate about making games. I am currently studying mathematics and computer science in Lyon, France.  
My favorite engines are [PICO-8](https://pico8.com/) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). I made a few games, you can check them out:  
* [🦆 Birds with Guns](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/birds-with-guns/), a tiny and frantic shooter set in a train. Claim back your eggs for the bird kingdom!  
* [🐞 Bugscraper](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper/), a platformer shooter set in an elevator. Rampage your way through a pest-infected tower!  
* [🦖 Pico Dino](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/pico-dino), a lively reimagination of Google Chrome's classic easter egg.  


🕹 My other games : [yolwoocle.itch.io](https://yolwoocle.itch.io)  
💻 My website and portfolio : [yolwoocle.github.io](https://yolwoocle.github.io/)

Here you can find the source code for my games and other silly projects.   
> Please feel free to reuse anything for your own projects, even if it's from my paid games. But unless stated explicitly, **please do not reuse my work in commercial projects without my permission first** (I will probably say yes!).  
> However, if this commercial project happens to be related to **cryptocurrencies or NFTs, please do not even bother to contact me, the answer is no**.

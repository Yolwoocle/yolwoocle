  <h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
</div>

🌵 Nice to meet you! I'm a developer from France passionate about making games. I love making colorful and lively games that bring joy. I am currently studying mathematics and computer science. 
My favorite engines are [PICO-8](https://pico8.com/) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). I made a few games, you can check them out:  
* [🦆 Birds With Guns](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/birds-with-guns/), a tiny and frantic shooter set in a train. Claim back your eggs for the bird kingdom!  
* [🐞 Bugscraper](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper/), a platformer shooter set in an elevator. Rampage your way through a pest-infected tower!  
* [🦖 Pico Dino](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/pico-dino), a lively reimagination of Google Chrome's classic easter egg.  


🕹 My other games : [yolwoocle.itch.io](https://yolwoocle.itch.io)  
💻 My website and portfolio : [yolwoocle.github.io](https://yolwoocle.github.io/)

You can find the source code for my games and other silly projects here on GitHub.

But unless stated explicitly, **please do not reuse my work in commercial projects without my permission first** (I will probably say yes!

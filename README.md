  <h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
</div>

🌵 Nice to meet you! I'm a computer science student from France passionate about the creation of video games. I never settle on a single tool and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges, hoping to bring people joy through colorful and lively games. I also love cycling, rock climbing and those amazing chocolate glazed jelly cookies.
My favorite engines are [PICO-8](https://pico8.com/) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). I made a few games, you can check them out:  
* [🦆 Birds With Guns](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/birds-with-guns/), a tiny and frantic shooter set in a train. Claim back your eggs for the bird kingdom! [Source code](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/birds_with_guns)
* [🐞 Bugscraper](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper/), a platformer shooter set in an elevator. Rampage your way through a pest-infected tower! [Source code](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/bugscraper)
* [🦖 Pico Dino](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/pico-dino), a lively reimagination of Google Chrome's classic easter egg.  

💻 My website and portfolio : [yolwoocle.com](https://yolwoocle.com/)

You can find the source code for my games and other silly projects here on GitHub.
